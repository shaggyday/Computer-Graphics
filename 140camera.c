/* Sets the six projection parameters, based on the width and height of the 
viewport and three other parameters. The camera looks down the center of the 
viewing volume. For perspective projection, fovy is the full (not half) 
vertical angle of the field of vision, in radians. focal > 0 is the distance 
from the camera to the focal plane (where 'focus' is used in the sense of 
attention, not optics). ratio expresses the far and near clipping planes 
relative to focal: far = -focal * ratio and near = -focal / ratio. Reasonable 
values are fovy = M_PI / 6.0, focal = 10.0, and ratio = 10.0, so that 
far = -100.0 and near = -1.0, but really they depend on the scene being 
rendered. For orthographic projection, the projection parameters are set to 
produce the orthographic projection that, at the focal plane, is most similar 
to the perspective projection just described. You must re-invoke this function 
after each time you change the viewport or projection type. */
